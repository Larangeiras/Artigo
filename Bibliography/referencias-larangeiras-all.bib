Abstract = {The covariance matrix plays an important role in statistical inference, yet modeling a covariance matrix is often a difficult task in practice due to its dimensionality and the non-negative definite constraint. In order to model a covariance matrix effectively it is typically broken down into components based on modeling considerations or mathematical convenience. Decompositions that have received recent research attention include variance components, spectral decomposition, Cholesky decomposition, and matrix logarithm. In this paper we study a statistically motivated decomposition which appears to be relatively unexplored for the purpose of modeling. We model a covariance matrix in terms of its corresponding standard deviations and correlation matrix. We discuss two general modeling situations where this approach is useful: shrinkage estimation of regression coefficients, and a general
location-scale model for both categorical and continuous variables. We
present some simple choices for priors in terms of standard deviations
and the correlation matrix, and describe a straightforward computational strategy for obtaining the posterior of the covariance matrix. We apply our method to real and simulated data sets in the context of shrinkage estimation.},

Title = {{Nonconjugate Bayesian estimation of covariance matrices and its use in

Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{94}},
Number = {{448}},
Pages = {{1254-1263}},
Month = {{Dec}},
Abstract = {{The problem of estimating a covariance matrix in small samples has been
   considered by several authors following early work by Stein. This
   problem can be especially important in hierarchical models where the
   standard errors of fixed and random effects depend on estimation of the
   covariance matrix of the distribution of the random effects. We propose
   a set of hierarchical priors (HPs) for the covariance matrix that
   produce posterior shrinkage toward a specified structure-here we examine
   shrinkage reward diagonality. We then address the computational
   difficulties raised by incorporating these priors, and nonconjugate
   priors in general, into hierarchical models. We apply a combination of
   approximation, Gibbs sampling (possibly with a Metropolis step), and
   importance reweighting to fit the models, and compare this hybrid
   approach to alternative Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. Our
   investigation involves three alternative HPs. The first works with the
   spectral decomposition of the covariance matrix and produces both
   shrinkage of the eigenvalues toward each other and shrinkage of the
   rotation matrix toward the identity. The second produces shrinkage of
   the correlations toward 0, and the third uses a conjugate Wishart
   distribution to shrink toward diagonality. A simulation study shows that
   the first two HPs can be very effective in reducing small-sample risk,
   whereas the conjugate Wishart version sometimes performs very poorly. We
   evaluate the computational algorithm in the context of a normal
   nonlinear random-effects model and illustrate the methodology with a
   logistic random-effects model.}},

Abstract = {{Correlation and covariance matrices provide the basis for all classical
   multivariate techniques. Many statistical tools exist for analyzing
   their structure but, surprisingly, there are few techniques for
   exploratory visual display, and for depicting the patterns of relations
   among variables in such matrices directly, particularly when the number
   of variables is moderately large. This article describes a set of
   techniques we subsume under the name ``corrgram,{''} based on two main
   schemes: (a) Rendering the value of a correlation to depict its sign and
   magnitude. We consider some of the properties of several iconic
   representations, in relation to the kind of task to be performed. (b)
   Reordering the variables in a correlation matrix so that ``similar{''} variables are
   positioned adjacently, facilitating perception. In
   addition, the extension of this visualization to matrices for
   conditional independence and partial independence is described and
   illustrated, and we provide an easily used SAS implementation of these
   methods.}},

Abstract = {{A d-dimensional positive definite correlation matrix R = (rho(ij)) can
   be parametrized in terms of the correlations rho(i,i+1) for i = 1,..., d
   - 1, and the partial correlations rho(ij\textbackslash{}i+1,.... j-1)
   for j - i >= 2. These ((d)(2)) parameters can independently take values
   in the interval (- 1, 1). Hence we can generate a random positive
   definite correlation matrix by choosing independent distributions F-ij,
   1 <= i < j <= d, for these ((d)(2)) parameters. We obtain conditions on
   the F-ij so that the joint density of (rho(ij)) is proportional to a
   power of det(R) and hence independent of the order of indices defining
   the sequence of partial correlations. As a special case, we have a
   simple construction for generating R that is uniform over the space of
   positive definite correlation matrices. As a byproduct, we determine the
   volume of the set of correlation matrices in ((d)(2))-dimensional space.
   To prove our results, we obtain a simple remarkable identity which
   expresses det(R) as a function of rho(i,i+1) for i = 1,..., d - 1, and
   p(ij\textbackslash{}i+1,... j-1) for j - i >= 2. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Health care quality surveys in the United States are administered to
   individual respondents (i.e.. hospital patients, health plan members) to
   evaluate the performance of health care organizations (i.e., hospitals,
   health plans). which thus Constitute estimation domains. For better
   understanding and more parsimonious reporting of dimensions of quality,
   we analyze relationships among., quality Measures at the domain level.
   Rather than specifying a full parametric model for the observed
   responses and the nonresponse patterns at the lower (patient) level. we
   first fit generalized variance-covariance functions that take into
   account nonresponse patterns in the survey responses, then specify a
   likelihood function for the domain mean responses using these
   generalized variance-covariance functions. This allows us to model
   directly the relationships among domain means for different items.
   Because the response scales are bounded. we assume that these means
   follow a truncated multivariate normal distribution. We calculate
   maximum likelihood (ML) estimates using the EM algorithm and sample
   under Bayesian models using Markov chain Monte Carlo. Finally. we
   perform factor analysis on the estimated or sampled between-domain
   covariance matrixes. Using posterior draws, we assess posterior
   distributions of the number of selected factors and the assignment of
   items to groups under conventional rules. We compare ML estimates of

   different prior distributions for the between-domain covariance. We

   Providers and Systems (CAHPS) survey of Medicare Advantage health plans.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a diffusion model for the analysis of

   allowing the parameters of the diffusion process to vary randomly over
   different persons. With this approach, both intra and interindividual
   differences are analyzed simultaneously. Furthermore, the individual
   difference parameters can be regressed on covariates, thereby providing
   an explanation of between-person differences. Unstructured and
   unbalanced data pose no problem for the model to be applied. We
   demonstrate the method on data from an experience sampling study to
   investigate changes in the core affect. It can be concluded that
   different factors from the five factor model of personality are related
   to features of the trajectories in the core affect space, such as the

	to obtain good results with noisy data, is described by means of
	the multiclass Potts model, and an iterated conditional modes classification
	algorithm that employs pseudolikelihood is proposed. The data are
	described using multivariate Gaussian laws and fully multilook polarimetric
	distributions arising from the multiplicative model. L-band, C-band,
	and both bands are used to assess the influence of dimensionality
	on the classification. Contextual and pointwise maximum-likelihood
	classifications are compared using real data. Results show that both

  abstract = {Among the frameworks for Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image modelling
	and analysis, the multiplicative model is very accurate and successful.
	It is based on the assumption that the observed random field is the
	result of the product of two independent and unobserved random fields:
	$X$ and $Y$. The random field $X$ models the terrain backscatter
	and, thus, depends only on the type of area each pixel belongs to.
	The random field $Y$ takes into account that SAR images are the result
	of a coherent imaging system that produces the well known phenomenon
	called speckle noise, and that they are generated by performing an
	average of n statistically independent images (looks) in order to
	reduce the noise effect. There are various ways of modelling the
	random field $X$; recently Frery et. al (1997) proposed the $\Gamma^{-1/2}(\alpha,\gamma)$
	distribution. This, with the usual $\Gamma^{1/2}(n,n)$ distribution
	for the amplitude speckle, resulted in a new distribution for the
	return: the $\mathcal G_A^0(\alpha,\gamma,n)$ law. The parameters
	$\alpha$ and $\gamma$ depend only on the ground truth, and n is the
	number of looks. The advantage of this istribution over the ones
	used in the past is that it models very well extremely heterogeneous
	areas like cities, as well as moderately heterogeneous areas like
	forests, and homogeneous areas like pastures as well. As the ground
	truth can be characterized by the parameters alpha and gamma, their
	estimation in each pixel generates parameter maps that can be used
	as the input for classification methods. In this work, moment estimators
	are used on simulated and on real SAR images and, then, a supervised
	classification technique (Gaussian maximum likelihood) is performed
	and evaluated. Excellent classification results are obtained.},

	thus requiring a careful statistical modelling. This modelling may
	lead to useful or useless techniques for image processing and analysis,
	according to the agreement between the data and their assumed properties.
	Several distributions have been used to describe synthetic aperture
	radar (SAR) data. Many of these univariate laws arise by assuming
	the multiplicative model, such as Rayleigh, square root of gamma,
	exponential, gamma, and the class of K distributions. The adequacy
	of these distributions depends on the detection (amplitude, intensity,

	In Frery et al. (1997), another class of univariate distributions,

	extends the univariate family to the multivariate multi-look polarimetric

	G0p the law. The main properties of this new multivariate distribution

Abstract = {{This paper studies the feasibility of monitoring crop growth based on a
   trend analysis of three elementary radar scattering mechanisms using
   three consecutive years (2008-2010) of RADARSAT-2 (R-2) Fine Quad Mode
   data. The polarimetric synthetic aperture radar analysis is based on the
   Pauli decomposition. Multitemporal analysis is applied to RGB images
   constructed using surface scattering, double-bounce, and volume
   scattering, along with intensity analysis of these scattering
   mechanisms. The test site is located in Eastern Ontario, Canada where
   the cropping system is dominated by corn, spring wheat, and soybeans.
   Each crop has unique physical structural characteristics which provide
   different responses for these scattering mechanisms. Significant changes
   occur in these scattering mechanisms as the crops move from one
   phenological stage to the next. By monitoring these changes over the
   season, the crop growth cycle from emergence to harvest can be observed.
   When harvest occurs, the backscatter intensities change significantly,
   and these changes aid in identifying crops. The temporal evaluation of
   the intensity of the scattering mechanisms generally track the measured
   leaf area index and observed phenological plant development. Changes in
   growth stage are crop type specific. Thus, to monitor changes in crop
   phenology and the occurrence of harvest activities, knowledge of the
   crop grown in any particular field is required. To accommodate this
   requirement, a maximum likelihood classification was performed on the
   R-2 data to produce a crop map. An overall classification accuracy of
   {85\%} was achieved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores the use of full polarimetric synthetic aperture
   radar (PolSAR) images for tsunami damage investigation from the
   polarimetric viewpoint. The great tsunami induced by the earthquake of
   March 11th, 2011, which occurred beneath the Pacific off the
   northeastern coast of Japan, is adopted as the study case using the
   Advanced Land Observing Satellite/Phased Array type L-band Synthetic
   Aperture Radar multitemporal PolSAR images. The polarimetric scattering
   mechanism changes were quantitatively examined with model-based
   decomposition. It is clear that the observed reduction in the
   double-bounce scattering was due to a change into odd-bounce scattering,
   since a number of buildings were completely washed away, leaving
   relatively a rough surface. Polarization orientation (PO) angles in
   built-up areas are also investigated. After the tsunami, PO angle
   distributions from damaged areas spread to a wider range and fluctuated
   more strongly than those from the before-tsunami period. Two
   polarimetric indicators are proposed for damage level discrimination at
   the city block scale. One is the ratio of the dominant double-bounce
   scattering mechanism observed after-tsunami to that observed
   before-tsunami, which can directly reflect the amount of destroyed
   ground-wall structures in built-up areas. The second indicator is the
   standard deviation of the PO angle differences, which is used to
   interpret the homogeneity reduction of PO angles. Experimental results
   from after- and before-tsunami comparisons validate the efficiency of
   these indexes, since the built-up areas with different damage levels can
   be well discriminated. In addition, comparisons between before-tsunami
   pairs further confirm the stability of the two polarimetric indexes over
   a long temporal duration. These interesting results also demonstrate the
   importance of full polarimetric information for natural disaster
   assessment.}},

Abstract = {{The estimation of volumetric soil moisture under low agricultural
   vegetation from fully polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data
   at L-band using a multi-angular polarimetric decomposition is
   investigated. Radar polarimetry provides the framework to decompose the
   backscattered signal into different canonical scattering mechanisms
   referring to scattering contributions from the underlying soil and the
   vegetation cover. Multiangular observation diversity further increases
   the information space for soil moisture inversion enabling higher
   inversion rates and a stable inversion performance. The developed
   approach was applied on the multi-angular L-band data set acquired by
   German Aerospace Center's ESAR sensor as part of the OPAQUE campaign in
   2008. The obtained results are compared against ground measurements
   collected by the OPAQUE team over a variety of vegetated agricultural
   fields. The validation of the estimated against ground measured soil
   moisture results in an root mean square error level of 6-8 vol.\%
   including all test fields with a variety of crop types.}},

   Matrix Data}},

Volume = {{52}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a general scheme for complete model-based decomposition
   of the polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (POLSAR) coherency matrix
   data is presented. We show that the POLSAR coherency matrix can be
   completely decomposed into three components contributed by volume
   scattering and two single scatterers (characterized by rank-1 matrices).
   Under this scheme, solving for the volume scattering power amounts to a
   generalized eigendecomposition problem, and the nonnegative power
   constraint uniquely determines the minimum eigenvalue as the volume
   scattering power. Furthermore, in order to discriminate the remaining
   components, we propose two approaches. One is based on
   eigendecomposition, and the other is based on model fitting, both of
   which are shown to properly resolve the surface and double-bounce
   scattering ambiguity. As a result, this paper in particular contributes
   to two pending needs for model-based POLSAR decomposition. First, it
   overcomes negative power problems, i.e., all the decomposed powers are
   strictly guaranteed to be nonnegative; and second, the three-component
   decomposition exactly accounts for every element of the observed
   coherency matrix, leading to a complete utilization of the fully
   polarimetric information.}},

Abstract = {{Orientation angle compensation was incorporated into model-based
   decomposition to cure overestimation of the volume scattering
   contribution for interpretation of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar
   (PolSAR) data. The compensation is based on rotating the coherency
   matrix to minimize the cross-polarization term. However, this processing
   cannot always guarantee that the double-and odd-bounce scattering
   components will be rotated back to zero orientation angle and left with
   zero cross-polarization power. As a result, built-up patches with large
   orientation angles may still suffer from the scattering mechanism
   ambiguity. In this paper, double-and odd-bounce scattering models were
   generalized to fit the cross-polarization and off-diagonal terms, by
   separating their independent orientation angles. A general decomposition
   framework is proposed that utilizes all elements of a coherency matrix.
   The residual minimization criterion is used for model inversion. All the
   model parameters are simultaneously obtained using a nonlinear least
   squares optimization technique. The manual intervention, branch
   conditions, and negative power issues are avoided. The performance and
   advantages of this approach are demonstrated and evaluated with
   spaceborne L-band ALOS/PALSAR and airborne X-band Pi-SAR PolSAR data
   sets. Comparison studies are also carried out and demonstrate that
   further improved decomposition performance is achieved by the proposed
   method, especially in oriented built-up areas.}},

Abstract = {{This paper outlines a general framework for ordering information in
   visual displays (tables and graphs) according to the effects or trends
   which we desire to see. This idea, termed effect-ordered data displays,
   applies principally to the arrangement of unordered factors for
   quantitative data and frequency data, and to the arrangement of
   variables and observations in multivariate displays (star plots,
   parallel coordinate plots, and so forth).
   As examples of this principle, we present several techniques for
   ordering items, levels or variables ``optimally{''}, based on some
   desired criterion. All of these may be based on eigenvalue or
   singular-value decompositions.
   Along the way, we tell some stories about data display, illustrated by
   graphs-some surprisingly bad, and some surprisingly good-for showing
   patterns, trends, and anomalies in data. We hope to raise more questions
   than we can provide answers for. (C) 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},
